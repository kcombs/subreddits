#Stylesheets for Reddit

Since [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) only allows a few CSS3 features I figured it'd be a good place to practice the basics on top of a pretty structured framework. Might also try throwing in some [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) stylesheets as well if I get bored. I'd like to use this to work on my structuring as well.

Images will be included in each folder, make sure to name them the same title as listed or be prepared to hunt down each time it's used in the CSS and change that too, hopefully I'll be using mostly sprites.
